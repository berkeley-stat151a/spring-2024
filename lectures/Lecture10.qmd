# Estimating the residual variance


## Method 1: Apply LLN to the squared residuals


## Method 2: Projection to get the unbiased estimate


(Note connection to RSS.)



# Putting it all together

For large $N$, we thus have (approximately),

$$
\y_\new - \yhat_\new \sim \gauss{0, \sigmahat^2}
\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad
\y_\new \sim \gauss{\yhat_\new, \sigmahat^2}
$$.

Let's see how it does with some data!
